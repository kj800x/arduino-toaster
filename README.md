# Ardunio Toaster Firmware

## Lets get toasty!

This repository contains the code for our Ardunio Reflow Soldering Oven.

## Setup 

We're using the Arduno IDE, so install that. We use a couple of external libraries for the thermocouples. These are saved in our libraries folder, and in order to use them, you need to tell your IDE about them.

Open up a blank sketch in the IDE, go to "Sketch" > "Include Library" > "Add .ZIP Library" and include each of the libraries. Then restart your IDE and the libraries should appear in the "Sketch" > "Include Library" menu, and the bundled examples should appear in the "File" > "Examples" menu.

The main sketch file is "main.ino" in the "main" folder.
